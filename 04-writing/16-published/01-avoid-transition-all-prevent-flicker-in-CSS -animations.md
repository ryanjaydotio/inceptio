Hi it's RJ, and today I want to share about the risk of `transition: all` in
CSS.

## The Symptom

While implementing a dark mode toggle, I ran into a small but surprisingly
distracting visual issue. During the theme transition, the social media icons on
the page would briefly flash before settling into their correct color, while the
rest of the UI transitioned smoothly.

At first, the behavior pointed to something more complex: a hydration mismatch,
a delayed theme state update, or possibly an SVG rendering quirk. After spending
more time than I care to admit inspecting React DevTools and revisiting theme
logic, the true cause turned out to be far simpler.

## The Root Cause

The issue wasn’t React, the theme toggle, or the build setup. It was a single
line of CSS:

```css
transition: all;
```

The social icons were styled using the `filter` property for color adjustments.
By declaring `transition: all`, the browser was instructed to animate _every_
animatable property whenever a change occurred.

During the theme switch, this caused certain properties—particularly `filter`—to
pass through intermediate or invalid visual states. The result was a brief
flicker as the browser attempted to interpolate values that were never meant to
be animated together.

## The FIX

Once the problem was clear, the solution was straightforward: scope the
transition to only the property that actually needed animation.

Here’s the updated CSS:

```css
.socials__icon {
  /* Transition only filter to prevent unwanted flickers */
  transition: filter var(--transition-duration-normal);
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0 transparent);
}
```

In practical terms, this meant replacing:

```css
transition: all;
```

with:

```css
transition: filter;
```

The result was immediate and definitive. The flicker disappeared entirely.

- No JavaScript changes
- No theme logic updates
- No framework-level debugging

Just a properly scoped transition.

## A Lesson in transition: all

> `transition: all` is convenient — but often dangerous.

While it’s tempting to use `transition: all` for speed and simplicity, it can
easily introduce unintended side effects. Animating every possible property can:

- Trigger unexpected visual glitches during state changes
- Produce strange intermediate render states
- Make UI bugs harder to diagnose and reason about

Explicitly defining which properties should transition leads to safer, more
predictable behavior—and avoids subtle regressions that can slip past code
review.

This issue was a good reminder that not all bugs stem from complex logic or
architectural decisions. Sometimes, a single careless line of CSS is enough to
create a disproportionately frustrating problem.

## Key Takeaway

Be intentional with your transitions. Animate only the properties you actually
need, and avoid `transition: all` unless you truly mean it. Small details like
this can make the difference between a polished UI and one plagued by subtle
visual inconsistencies.
