Hi it's RJ, and today I want to share how I learned TypeScript through
constraints rather than tutorials.

## The Philosophy

When I decided to learn TypeScript, I didn't start with a tutorial or a cheat
sheet. I started by turning on strict mode.

Not because I understood what every option did—but because I wanted the language
to push back. I wanted the compiler and my tooling to surface the gaps in my
understanding instead of letting them slip quietly into production.

As someone new to TypeScript but not new to JavaScript, I've learned that
comfort is rarely a good teacher. Loose configurations let you move fast, but
they also let misunderstandings hide. Strict configurations do the opposite—they
interrupt you, slow you down, and force you to be explicit.

## The ESLint Setup

So instead of easing into TypeScript, I chose to begin with a strict tsconfig
and a conservative ESLint setup. Not to be "correct" from day one, but to create
a feedback loop where every warning meant something I didn't yet understand.

This meant setting up my tooling in a way that wouldn't let me "accidentally"
write unsafe code. I wanted ESLint and TypeScript to be noisy—especially early
on—so every warning became a prompt to learn, not something to ignore.

Here's an example of how I configure my `eslint.config.js` in a Vite + React +
TypeScript project.

```javascript
import jsxA11y from "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y";
import reactPlugin from "eslint-plugin-react";
import reactHooks from "eslint-plugin-react-hooks";
import reactRefresh from "eslint-plugin-react-refresh";
import globals from "globals";
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint";

export default [
  {
    ignores: ["dist", "node_modules", "build", ".vite"],
  },
  {
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    languageOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: "latest",
      globals: globals.browser,
      parser: tseslint.parser,
      parserOptions: {
        project: ["./tsconfig.app.json", "./tsconfig.node.json"],
      },
    },
    settings: {
      react: {
        version: "detect",
      },
    },
    plugins: {
      "@typescript-eslint": tseslint.plugin,
      react: reactPlugin,
      "jsx-a11y": jsxA11y,
      "react-hooks": reactHooks,
      "react-refresh": reactRefresh,
    },
    rules: {
      ...reactPlugin.configs.recommended.rules,

      ...jsxA11y.configs.recommended.rules,

      ...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules,

      "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off",
      "react/jsx-uses-react": "off",
      "react/prop-types": "off",

      ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked[0].rules,
      ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked[0].rules,

      "@typescript-eslint/prefer-nullish-coalescing": "error",
      "@typescript-eslint/prefer-optional-chain": "error",
      "@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-condition": "error",
      "@typescript-eslint/strict-boolean-expressions": "error",
      "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "error",
      "@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type": "error",

      "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": [
        "error",
        { argsIgnorePattern: "^_", varsIgnorePattern: "^_" },
      ],

      "@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type": "error",
      "@typescript-eslint/explicit-module-boundary-types": "error",

      "react-refresh/only-export-components": [
        "error",
        { allowConstantExport: true },
      ],
    },
  },
];
```

This setup is intentionally strict. Some of these rules slowed me down at first,
and that was the point. Each error forced me to ask _why_ TypeScript was
unhappy—and that question is where the learning happened.

## The TypeScript Configuration

After setting up strict linting, I carried the same philosophy into my
TypeScript configuration.

The goal wasn't completeness—it was clarity. Each environment should fail loudly
in ways that actually matter to it.

And this is how I setup `tsconfig.app.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["ES2024", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": false,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
    "strict": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src", "prettier.config.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

## Key Options That Shaped My Understanding

Turning on `strict` was non-negotiable. It ensured that TypeScript would always
assume the least about my code unless I proved otherwise.

`exactOptionalPropertyTypes` forced me to be honest about my data models.
Optional didn't mean "sometimes undefined"—it meant _truly optional_.

Another excellent choice is `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. Arrays and objects stop
feeling "safe", this helps me learn defensive access patterns naturally.

`noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` subtly teaches me about structural typing,
why loose objects are dangerous and when to model with records vs interfaces.

`verbatimModuleSyntax + isolatedModules` These options pushed me to write code
that behaves the same way at runtime as it does in my head—no hidden
transformations, no surprises.

## The Node.js Configuration

The way I handle Node `tsconfig.node.json` is strict in the same way but scoped
differently.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "tsBuildInfoFile": "./node_modules/.tmp/tsconfig.node.tsbuildinfo",
    "target": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["ES2024"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": false,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
    "strict": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["vite.config.ts", "vitest.config.ts", "scripts/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

The Node config mirrors most of the same constraints, but removes anything
browser-specific. Keeping them aligned helps me build a consistent mental model
while still respecting the environment I'm targeting.

I didn't understand all of these options upfront. Some of them only made sense
_after_ they broke my assumptions. That breakage is what made them valuable.

## Additional Tools for Learning

I also came across a great extension to learn TypeScript
[Total TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/vscode-extension). I'm still
figuring out how to use this inside Neovim, but for the time being I installed
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to experiment with TypeScript and use
it alongside
[Pretty TypeScript Errors](https://open-vsx.org/extension/yoavbls/pretty-ts-errors).

Here's how I use it on my own Vite + React + TypeScript
[Blog](https://github.com/rjleyva/rjleyva-writes).

## Key Takeaway

Constraints are free. The compiler doesn't care how you learned—only whether
your assumptions hold. This approach taught me that the most valuable learning
happens when your tools force you to confront your misunderstandings early,
creating a feedback loop that builds true understanding rather than memorized
patterns.
