# CompAnalyst Market Data

## Introduction

Hi **John**! It's **Ryan**, and I’m one of the **Solutions Consultants here at
Salary.com**. Thank you for your time today.

## Discovery

Thank you for sharing that context, John. Based on what you’ve described, I
believe the best solution to focus on is CompAnalyst Market Data, our
best-selling tool for straight cash compensation.

CompAnalyst Market Data relies exclusively on HR-reported data—there is no
crowdsourced or self-reported employee data involved. The data is refreshed on
the first day of every month, allowing you to consistently track where you are
today and where you need to be.

In addition, the solution includes the [CompAnalyst AI](./03-caai.md), which
helps streamline key processes such as market pricing, job matching, and
more—significantly reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.

If you’re looking for a more traditional survey that includes **healthcare
benefits and retirement compensation**, we also offer our
[CompData Survey](./03-compdata-survey.md). For broader coverage, our global
[IPAS Survey]() includes elements such as car and housing allowances, among many
others.

We also provide a job-scraping tool called [Salary IQ](), which serves as a
strong complementary solution alongside CompAnalyst.

With a subscription, you’ll get unlimited users and unlimited use to the tool.
You’ll also have dedicated support, which means you can reach out directly via
phone or email. On top of that, you’ll have access to live chat support, and we
have a full library of training materials online, and 10 free job requests each
year.

If you’re having trouble finding a match for a particular role, just send us the
job description. Within 2–3 business days, our experienced compensation team
will find the best match — based on the job’s actual responsibilities, not just
the title. As you know, John, titles can be a bit tricky these days.”

Here, you have two ways to market-price a job. First, you can use the search bar
if you already have a job title in mind. Alternatively, you can click the
‘Browse Jobs’ button to explore over 15,000 job titles.

As we all know, the job description matters more than the title — and that’s why
we provide detailed job descriptions for each role to help you find the most
accurate match.

Right now, we have 42 job families, and you can narrow down your search based on
the function you select here.

We offer a wide range of job levels — from entry-level roles all the way up to
executive positions — as well as detailed job categories, from support functions
to specialized areas like education.

Before we move on to the next part, let me first share with you an additional
functionality of CompAnalyst in this section.

## Save to Job List

One of the key features here is ‘Save to Job List’ for quick bulk pricing. You
can even create separate lists by department or by location, depending on your
needs. All the lists you create are automatically updated on the first day of
each month.

So the next time you need updated salary information, just go to your saved
jobs, pull up your list, and the data will already be refreshed for you. It’s
that simple to stay on top of salary and market movements on a monthly basis.

## Job Matching & Comparison

- The next key features is **"Match to Company Jobs"**, which helps align your
  roles to CompAnalyst Market Data jobs via job description.

## Compare

- We also have a **Compare** tool that shows a side-by-side comparison of
  multiple job levels or titles—very useful when evaluating role progression or
  differences.

## Multiple Hats and Hybrid Jobs

- If you’re managing employees who wear multiple hats, you can use the **Hybrid
  Jobs** feature.
- It allows you to blend multiple roles by assigning different workload
  percentages to each.
- CompAnalyst automatically calculates the weighted compensation based on those
  values.
- At the moment, this supports **Base** and **TCC**, and later, I’ll show you
  how to bring in additional metrics like **LTI**, **salary structure**, and
  more.

## Creating a Hybrid Job

- Here’s where you create a custom **Hybrid Job Title**, **Job Code**, and write
  your own **Hybrid Job Description**.
- This allows you to tailor the role precisely to your organization's needs.

## Quick Check-In

- _“John, before we move into the scoping section, any questions or thoughts on
  what we've covered so far?”_

## Selecting a Job Title Example

- “Great! Do you have a job title in mind we can use as today’s example?”

- If not, let’s go with **Account Manager** for our demonstration.

## Sample Job

- You can explore the **Details** tab to review the job description and other
  key info.
- A major upgrade with the new Market Data tool is the ability to price
  **multiple jobs and levels at once**.
- After selecting a title, we define the **location, industry, company size, and
  revenue range**.

## Selecting Location Scope

- _“When you search for salary data, do you typically check local, state,
  regional, or national levels?”_
- For **national-level data**, simply select “All U.S.”
- You can select **regions**, **states**, **metros**, or even **ZIP codes** for
  deeper granularity.
- CompAnalyst will return salary data for each level you choose.

## Industry & Company Size Selection

- Choose your **industry** first—each one has a set of relevant sub-industries
  for better accuracy.
- Then define your **company size**. You can even compare across different size
  ranges to see how comp scales with org size.

## Scope Management

- Give your scope a **custom name**.
- Save it as **Private** (just for you) or **Public** (for your entire team to
  reuse later).

## Pricing View Overview

- Before we start the slicing and dicing — _“Any questions at this point,
  John?”_

- In the pricing view:
  - **Top-left:** Job summary (title, level, and description)
  - **Top-right:** Customizable **compensable factors** modules.
  - **Bottom:** Salary data table, broken down by selected levels or areas

## Making the Report More Comprehensive

  **Scopes** button.

- You’ll open a config window where you can:
  - Add **percentiles (5th to 95th)**
  - Align data to your **pay philosophy**
  - Expand the view with **bonus %, LTI eligibility**, and **salary structure**

## Adding More Metrics (edit)

- In the same window, toggle on additional insights like:
  - **TCC Actual vs. Target**
  - **Hourly vs. Annual rate**
  - **Currency display**, with monthly-updated exchange rates

## Adjusting Pricing Factors

  - **Years of experience**, **tenure**, **education level**

  - **Schedule type**, **FLSA status**, **security clearance**

## Competencies & Skills

- You’ll also see a section for **Alternate Titles**—a helpful reference for
  similar roles in the market.
- Then, you can review and customize the **Skills & Competencies** required for
  the role.
- Add more via the **search bar**, or remove any by clicking **X**.
- Once done, click **Apply**, and the system will recalculate accordingly.

## Adding Custom Skills

- Have a niche skill that’s not listed? No worries.
- Type it into the search bar, click **Add**, then hit **Apply**—the system will
  include it in your analysis.

## Skill-Based Premiums

- By default, a **1.1% market adjustment** is applied for each added skill.
- This is an average value—some skills (e.g., **CPA**) may adjust more depending
  on market data.

---

## Managerial Responsibility Adjustments

- Adjust **managerial responsibilities** to reflect team size, level of
  oversight, or direct reports.

- Click **Recalculate Comp**, and you’ll see:
  - **White bar:** Original compensation
  - **Blue bar:** Compensation after adjustments

## Saving Adjusted Jobs

- In the **top-right corner**, click to **Save** your adjusted job.
- Assign a **new job title**, **job code**, and save it for future use.
- Best part: **Your saved jobs auto-update** every 1st of the month, when our
  dataset refreshes.

## Exporting Reports

- Ready to share the data? You can export your report as a:
  - **PDF**
  - **Excel**
  - **CSV**
  - **ZIP file**

- Or send it via **email or SMS** to teammates—even if they don’t have access to
  the tool!

## Job Focus Report – Career Path Tool

- One last thing I want to show you is the **Job Focus Report**.

- It’s super helpful for:
  - **Career progression discussions**
  - **Job leveling exercises**

- For example, if an employee asks: _“Hey Johnny, what would it take for me to
  move up a level?”_ —this report lays it out:
  - **Years of experience**
  - **Education requirements**
  - **Role-specific expectations**

- You can export this report to **PDF** or **Excel** for easy sharing.

## Wrap-up

- _“And that wraps up our walkthrough of CompAnalyst Market Data—from A to Z!”_
  _“John, what did you think of the tool? Any features you’re most excited to
  try out?”_
