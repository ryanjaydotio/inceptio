## Introduction

OK, let me tell you a little bit about the company and what we do here, what to
offer, just so you are familiar, I'm not gonna spend a ton of time on it but I
do like to make sure that when you are looking for an additional solution, you
can contact us because you know that we have everything that you need. We've
been around for over 20 years and a lot of customers or a lot of prospects are
familiar with our free website.

## CAMD Overview

We offer multiple data sources and different solutions, we have CompAnalyst
Market Data the data that we purchased, so we go load and buy types of surveys
from the biggest companies or organizations that people have heard of, we have a
wonderful agreement, and we bring hundreds and hundreds of purchased surveys
together into a very powerful huge database, normalize everything into our job
industry, geography taxonomy, we have an extremely robust of data 16,000 titles,
225 industries are represented in it, not fully global but we have a great set
of data in the US, UK as well as CA.

It is not a participant so you buy the data you get a subscription, The great
thing about this is you can model it, you can adjust it, so if you want a
specific job to have specific skills or certification you just add that and CAMD
will price it based on the premium. (1.1 percent adjustment).

## **IPAS Overview**

It's a little bit different from our CompData survey, it is a traditional
survey, meaning you are required to participate to get access to the product and
in return, we give you access to our database, and the data is updated quarterly
with new participation as a new company come into the survey they represented in
it, so every 90 days we updated the survey for you (January, April, July, and
October).

## Job Architect Overview

JobArchitect Model is where you can build up your job descriptions and manage
those across your management team.

## CompData Introduction

The way we do things is meant to help you get more data, more often to keep up
with the market changes. We work off with a rolling participation model and that
means if you were to sign up for this survey today you gain access to the data
within 24 to 72 hours and that would start a 60-day window for you to submit
your participation.

That 60-day window allows us to update the data within our survey quarterly, and
you are only required to participate once per year, so do not worry you will get
quarterly updates but are not required to participate every quarter. Extensions
are permitted and granted by a dedicated Client Success Manager upon request.

When it comes to participation we make it easy for you.

There are 3 basic parts to data submission

- A brief company profile.
- Incumbent-level job pay data.
- Completion of a short benefits/pay practices questionnaire.

To reduce your time participation, we can also accept your payroll or HRIS files
extract, and if you are already participating in other surveys, We can have that
information as well.

And to make it more easier, you will have a dedicated customer success manager
who will help you when it comes to participation and data submission.

Surveys are 100% employer-reported and conducted by Salary.com.

Our data is collected directly from participants like you - executives, Human
Resources, and Compensation professionals.

We adheres to Safe Harbor Guidelines as defined by the Department of Justice and
the Federal Trade Commission. As such, data is aggregated and anonymized.

After this call, I'm happy to send you a participant report and data volume
report so you can go through and see what job titles are available.

## CompData Demo

Today, I will be walking you through a CompData Survey platform.

Within this tool, you will be able to pull custom reports, find benefits and pay
practices information as well and submit your participation file.

But much of the focus of today's call will be around results and reporting.

Now we are going to move to our survey results.

This is our main results page, and as you can see, we provide tons of options
for you.

  allow you to dump all the data into an Excel, CSV, or pdf file.

**Custom Job Reports**

- lastly, we have here Custom Job Reports - it allow you to slice and dice
  SALARY REPORTS BY SELECTING market and geographic criteria.

For now, we're going to spend our time going to a custom report, where you will
be able to drill down the survey and find the individual jobs you're looking
for.

When it comes to creating a custom job report, it's simple and can be shared
across multiple users.

And we have a wide variety of specific surveys.

But for today's demonstration, we will be focusing on your industry which is
CompData Health Care.

Before I proceed, I want to point out our benchmark mark pro survey, which
focuses a standard roles within organizations across multiple industries. This
page will vary depending on which survey you want to purchase.

## CompData Home Screen

As you can see right now, we have some basic and simple navigation.

We have job titles, geographic filters, report filters, and more.

And here we can search by job family or job title.

For now just to show you how the tool works, I'm going to type the job title, We
have different job titles that you can select, Once you pick the job titles,
down below we have a detailed job description for you have a quick glance of
what the work is like.

So I'm going to bring these job titles over to the right, and you can bring
multiple job titles if you want to.

**Click Next**

Now we do have the ability to show national data and break it down by region,
but we do have the ability to add a national data cut if that is something you
or your organization would like to use.

From here I can pull in the state of Phoenix and a group of present metros will
populate as well and I will bring that over to my cart, Now that we have all the
locations, we now move to the next steps.

## Custom Job Report

So from here, the survey platform is going to walk us through a series of stuff
to help you break down the data to your liking.

The first data here is the revenue. Because this is a demo I will going to
include all the breakouts for the next few categories. and of course, I will
post at each then we can take a look at the different scopes that we have
available here.

also please note that we will be able to see each of the breakouts once we see
the results.

- So we have here the number of beds.
- Next we have the FTEs.
- Followed by profit status, we have here for profit and no profit.
- Next is the sector status, we have here government public entity, publicly
  held (non - non-government) and privately held.
- We also have here teaching status.
- Next we have here the industry category. as you can see, we have multiple
  sub-industry contained within the survey and the CompData Healthcare, I'm
  going to bring all of that information.
- And our unique breakout here, the union status, so you have the ability to
  look at the union vs the non-union.
- We also have exemption status, exempt and non-exempt.
- Next would be the revenue.
- And we also have here the ability to break out the data by the effective date.

As you can see here, the most recent effective date is on Jan 1, 2023, our
CompData Survey is updated quarterly.

The second option would be to select at least 3 effective dates, this allows you
to run a report based on historical data or older data.

- CompData can also include or exclude organization data once you submit a
  participation file and here is where you can make that choice.
- You can also show your data separately to compare side by side against the
  market.
- Next, we can decide if you want to view the data at an annual rate or hourly.
  For now, I'm going to leave it as an annual rate but you can easily toggle
  this when viewing the results, I will show this to you when I get there.
- Here is one feature that you may find interesting, our reports come with a
  standard percentile, 25th, 50th, and 75th, On this page, you can add any
  percentile from 5th up to the 95th percentile. This allows you to access the
  percentile appropriate to your organization's pay practices.
- We have here also our aging factor, now we can filter your report by aging
  factor here, We have 3 options.

2nd option allows you to run a report based on a future date but of course, if
you are interested in learning more about on how we came up with the 2.7 percent
aging factor, you can click view our aging formula.

The 3rd option would allow you to run a report based on a future date but also
allow you to enter your preferred percentage to age the data instead of using
the 2.7 percentage.

- And now the last part will allow you to take it offline and also view the
  report online.

Down below you have the ability to view details or summary reports, For today we
are going to view details.

Please note that the summary report can be helpful when viewing multiple jobs at
a time.

- Here is where you can save the report, Just give it a name so you can save it
  across multiple users or for a future reference.

## Report

Now we are looking at some basic information from the report.

The job title, the number of organizations or incumbents in the room.

From here we can get into the data and view the full report here.

So if you had been a participant, you would see your participant data for your
account at the top (My Organization Data).

Below this is where you can start at the data, You will see that the data is
broken down by base rate, bonus, commission/tip, total compensation, and
policies.

our policies section includes information on pay ranges and hire-on pay.

As you can see right now, for the base and TCC, we have it broken down at the
25, 50, and 75th percentiles.

This is where any additional percentile would populate if you have added them in
creating this report.

You can also view the organization and incumbents gone for this individual
breakout.

Down below, you will be able to see the individual scope that we have selected
like the number of beds.

You can be more granular and jump to like a regional, maybe in state or local
and that is something you can find down here.
