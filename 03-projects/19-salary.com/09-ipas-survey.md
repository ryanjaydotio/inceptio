# IPAS Survey

## Questions

## Does Sales Consolidated include Marketing? If so, what is the difference between Job Function's Marketing and Sales Consolidated's Marketing?

- Yes, but there is a key distinction.
- **Sales Consolidated**: A broad job family grouping focused on sales-related
  roles only, including some sales-adjacent marketing positions (like Field
  Marketing or Channel Marketing that support revenue generation).
- Marketing (Job Function): A separate and distinct job function within IPAS
  that includes core marketing roles — digital marketing, brand, product
  marketing, market research, etc.
- “Marketing” is not a subcategory of “Sales Consolidated”.
- Sometimes you will noticed that The same job title (e.g., “Marketing Manager”)
  could appear in both if it supports sales directly vs. corporate marketing —
  but they would be benchmarked differently.

## If "Category" is selected by Size, does the sales size of the participant company appear in "Category Name"?

- Yes, when you select “Category” by Size in the Salary.com IPAS tool, the
  “Category Name” field typically reflects the sales revenue size of the
  participant companies.

- Here’s how it works: • Category Type: When you set this to “Size”, you’re
  telling IPAS to group or filter data based on company size. • Category Name:
  This will then display specific size ranges, usually based on annual revenue —
  such as: • Under `50M • `50M–`199M • `200M–`999M • `1B+, etc.

These ranges indicate the sales revenue bands of the participating companies
whose data is included in that category.

Why this matters: • It allows you to benchmark compensation data against
companies of similar size. • Since pay can vary significantly by company size
(larger companies often pay more due to scale, complexity, and resources), this
helps provide more accurate and relevant comparisons.

## Is Global High Technology the best fit category for Medical Device manufacturers?

- No, I highly recommend the Global Benchmark because this is where
  manufacturing companies are participating.

## Is this column the number of participating companies?

- Yes, and this one is the number of employees or private individuals represent
  the data points that I'm sharing to you right now.

## 50%ile Allowance Total?

- In Salary.com’s IPAS tool, the “50%ile Allowance Total” refers to the median
  (50th percentile) total amount of allowances provided to employees for a
  specific job or job family.

## Co Avg Inc Tgt % (Elig EEs)

- Company Average Increase Target Percentage (Eligible Employees)

Here’s what it means broken down: • Co = Company • Avg = Average • Inc Tgt % =
Increase Target Percentage (typically annual salary increase target) • (Elig
EEs) = Eligible Employees (employees eligible for the increase)

So altogether:

It represents the average planned or targeted salary increase percentage that
the company intends to give to the eligible employees during a given review
cycle (usually yearly).

## Co Avg Inc % PYA (Elig EEs)

- Company Average Increase Percentage Prior Year Actual (Eligible Employees)

- What it means: • Co = Company • Avg Inc % = Average Increase Percentage
  (actual salary increase given) • PYA = Prior Year Actual (what was actually
  awarded last year) • Elig EEs = Eligible Employees (those eligible to receive
  salary increases)

- This metric shows the average actual salary increase percentage that the
  company granted to eligible employees in the previous year.

- Why it matters: • It provides a historical benchmark of what companies
  actually awarded employees in terms of raises, not just what they planned or
  targeted. • Helps compare planned increases (targets) versus realized
  increases. • Useful to evaluate if companies met, exceeded, or fell short of
  their increase targets.

## EE Avg Flex

- Employee Average Flexibility

- What it means: • EE = Employee • Avg Flex = Average Flexibility (typically in
  salary increases or pay adjustments)

- Explanation:

This metric usually represents the average amount of salary increase flexibility
given per employee, often measured as a percentage. It reflects how much room
managers had to adjust pay increases beyond fixed merit guidelines or targets. •
For example, if the standard merit increase is set at 3%, but managers had
discretion to give slightly more or less based on performance or market factors,
the EE Avg Flex shows the average of those discretionary adjustments.

## EE Avg Hous

- Employee Average Housing Allowance

- What it means: • EE = Employee • Avg = Average • Hous = Housing allowance

- Explanation:

This metric represents the average amount of housing allowance provided to
employees in the selected group or benchmark. • Housing allowance is a common
benefit, especially in international assignments or regions with high living
costs. • It covers part or all of employees’ housing expenses (rent, utilities,
etc.).

## EE Avg Job

- Employee Average Job Salary (or Job Base Salary)

- What it means: • EE = Employee • Avg = Average • Job = Job base salary
  (typically the fixed base pay excluding bonuses, allowances, or other variable
  pay)

- Explanation:

This metric shows the average base salary for employees in the selected job or
job family. • It represents the typical fixed pay employees receive for their
job role before any additional compensation components like bonuses,
commissions, or allowances.

**International Pay Analysis System**

Here is where you can access the historical data from your contract start date.
I have full access right now because I’m using a demo account.

And as you see here, our search criteria are straightforward. You can search by
a single country or multiple countries, or sort countries by region. You can
select one or more Job Functions to report, as well as Job levels.

You also have the option to change the currency, and it's updated monthly to
keep up with the current exchange rate.

You can also age the data forward for you to check the forecasted data.

Now let’s talk about how we operate on a global leveling system.

- The first 3 digits of the job code represent the major function and
  sub-function of the role. The last two digits represent the job level.

And now I will run the report.

- Now it will return the country or countries I selected and the jobs that match
  those search criteria.

**NOTE**

We follow all Safe Harbor guidelines. If you're seeing fewer filters in a
particular category, it's because we don't have the number of incumbents and
organizations needed to represent data points.

Your report will be automatically populated with default percentiles (25th,
50th, and 75th). Don’t worry, I will later show you how to obtain percentiles
from the 10th to the 90th for Base and Target Total Cash (TTC).

You can also see the company size and revenues, and compare how other companies
manage pay for existing employees versus new hires based on the dataset.

- Base-/Total-
- Base/Total
- Base+/Total+ includes extra month bonuses and allowances associated with the
  position, like 13-month pay. This setup is commonly used in APAC.

Allowances

We have different allowances available and you can break them out individually
as you see fit.

If you click this tab here, it will give us a different view. What I love about
this view is that it provides detailed job functions and job level descriptions.

And this is how IPAS works from A to Z. As you can see, it’s elementary, basic,
and simple. As promised during our call, we’re happy to send you the
participants list and data volume report you can review the list to see what job
titles are available.
