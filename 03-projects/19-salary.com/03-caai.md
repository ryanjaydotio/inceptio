# CompAnalyst AI Suite

## What is LLM

- It is a system that's trained to understand and generate human language.
- They are called large because they are trained on massive amount of text like
  books, articles, forums, code, documentation and web.

## What separate us?

- Our AI is fully trained based on our 26 years of existence, we use different
  compensation patterns, grammar and many more, we put our hearts and mind into
  this AI to solve real world compensation problems.

Unlike other, we are not just pulling data from different publicly available
information from the world wide web which is a mix of personal and professional
opinions from different sources, some of it are updated and some are outdated,
and that leads to biased opinions and inaccurate information.

So choosing the right AI tool for compensation matters a lot.

# Salary AI Demo Script

CompAnalyst AI is an additional functionality of [[CompAnalyst Market Data]],
within this suite, we offer two types of AI:

1. **Generative AI** — specifically large language models (LLMs) — and they are
   called “large” because they are trained on vast amounts of data including
   text, forums, articles, compensation technical documentation, and HR-reported
   information from Salary.com. These interpret user prompts to generate
   intelligent, context-aware responses designed to address and solve complex
   compensation challenges.

2. **Gigantic AI** – built to handle tedious and complex compensation tasks.

## Market Pricing Agent

For example, the Market Pricing Agent was developed by our engineering team in
collaboration with experienced compensation professionals to streamline market
analysis, you can rely on the Market Pricing Agent to efficiently handle the
heavy lifting and deliver accurate, data-driven insights in seconds.

To ensure the most accurate results, the tool may ask follow-up questions based
on your prompt. You can also provide additional details or context at any time
to further refine and improve the responses.

The tool also displays detailed information about its process, including key
assumptions and the specific operations it performs. This transparency helps you
understand the reasoning and logic behind each result.

We encourage you to share feedback on whether the results were helpful. Your
input plays a key role in improving and refining the large language model,
enabling it to deliver even more accurate and valuable insights over time.

The tool can also generate visualizations, including bar charts and pie charts,
to help you interpret and present data more effectively.

## Job Description Writer

We also offer a Job Description Writer within our Job Architect tool, designed
to help you create clear, concise, and well-structured job descriptions in
minutes — ensuring consistency and accuracy across your organization.

## Company Deep Analysis Agent

The Company Deep Analysis Agent, available as an add-on to our Tier 2
subscription, CompAnalyst Plus, allows you to integrate your HRIS system and
import your employees’ wage and benefits data. It also includes a free Pay
Equity Overview. This agent is fully trained to deliver comprehensive analyses
using your organization’s own data.

Once your information is uploaded, you can then use the **Salary Structure
Agent** to effortlessly build accurate, data-driven salary structures tailored
to your organization’s needs.

## Using the Generative AI Tool

To use the generative AI tool, simply enter a prompt. Your prompts can reference
your company data, market pricing information, or Salary.com compensation
knowledge and best practices — and the AI will generate accurate, context-aware
insights based on your request.

For example, you could ask:

> “How many of my employees are paid below the 50th percentile of the market?”

To ensure the most accurate results, the tool may ask follow-up questions based
on your prompt. You can also provide additional details or context at any time
to further refine and improve the responses.

The tool also displays detailed information about its process, including key
assumptions and the specific operations it performs. This transparency helps you
understand the reasoning and logic behind each result.

We encourage you to share feedback on whether the results were helpful. Your
input plays a key role in improving and refining the large language model,
enabling it to deliver even more accurate and valuable insights over time.

## Interface Features

In the top-right corner, you’ll find additional options that let you maximize
the window, view your chat history, monitor usage, or start a new conversation.

Depending on your subscription tier, different large language models (LLMs) are
available. The model demonstrated here is included with CompAnalyst Market Data.

## Salary AI LLMs

We also offer the Salary.com LLM, which goes beyond your company data by
connecting to our extensive data sources — including CompAnalyst Market Data,
Salary IQ, and participant surveys such as CompData and IPAS — to deliver
deeper, market-wide compensation insights.

This model is ideal for answering market-level questions, such as:

> “What is the competitive pay rate for a Sales Manager in California?”

You can choose which datasets to search, and the LLM will identify the best job
matches based on your criteria. You can then refine the results further by
asking follow-up questions.

The third LLM we offer is Compensation Resources, which connects you to
Salary.com’s comprehensive knowledge base — including industry trends, insights,
user guides, and more. It’s best suited for general compensation questions, such
as:

> “What steps should I take when building a salary structure?”

In addition to providing answers, the LLM includes direct links to relevant
resources, offering detailed guidance and further context.

You can also use it to generate or summarize compensation-related regulations,
such as:

> “Summarize pay transparency laws in Illinois.”

The tool delivers both a direct answer and curated resources to ensure accuracy
and provide deeper, detailed information.

- Cons
  - Can't create peer groups.

## Optimized Prompts

If you’re unsure where to start, optimized prompts are available at the top of
the screen. We continually update these to deliver the most relevant and
accurate responses. As with other LLMs, you can refine the conversation at any
time by asking follow-up questions.

## Closing

- When working with AI, there are a few essential skills to develop:
  - Prompting effectively – learning how to communicate clearly with AI to get
    accurate results.
  - Understanding limitations – including how credit consumption works. If you
    use AI tools often, you know that credit usage can depend on the complexity
    of your questions. More detailed prompts may use additional resources to
    generate responses.

However, this doesn’t mean you should limit your input just to save credits.
Providing too little information often leads to multiple follow-up prompts,
which can end up using the same—or even more—credits overall.

The goal is to get the most accurate and useful response as quickly as possible,
saving you time and effort.

If you decide to sign up, rest assured that we’ll guide you through the process
and help you build these skills so you can make the most of your Salary AI Suite
LLM.
